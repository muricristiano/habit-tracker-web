# Habit Tracker Web
This repository contains the code for a habit tracker web application built with Vite and React.

## Technologies Used

### Vite
Vite is a fast, opinionated frontend build tool that provides a great development experience. It comes with features such as automatic build (esbuild), TypeScript support, and other essential tools for frontend development.

### React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage application state.

### Phosphor React
Phosphor React is a library that provides a set of icons for React applications. It offers a wide range of icons that can be easily integrated into the UI of the habit tracker web application.

### Day.js
Day.js is a lightweight and modern JavaScript library for manipulating, parsing, and formatting dates. It provides an easy-to-use API for working with dates and simplifies common date-related tasks in the habit tracker web application.

### @radix-ui

/react-dialog
/react-popover
/react-checkbox

radix-ui is a library that provides unstyled, accessible components for building high-quality design systems and web apps in React. 

### clsx
Clsx is a utility library that simplifies the creation of conditional class names. It allows for easy dynamic class composition, which is especially useful when working with Tailwind CSS or any CSS framework that relies on class-based styling.

### Axios
Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend and provides features such as request/response interceptors, automatic transformation of request/response data, and more. In the habit tracker web application, Axios is used for communicating with the backend API.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that allows developers to build modern and responsive user interfaces using utility classes. It provides a comprehensive set of pre-defined utility classes that can be combined to create custom styles and layouts.

### PostCSS
PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. It is often used as a build tool for optimizing and transforming CSS files. In the habit tracker web application, PostCSS is integrated with Tailwind CSS to process and optimize the CSS styles.

### Autoprefixer
Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules. It ensures cross-browser compatibility by adding the necessary vendor-specific prefixes to CSS properties.

These technologies and libraries work together to provide a solid foundation for building the habit tracker web application, enabling efficient frontend development, smooth user interface interactions, and optimized styling.
